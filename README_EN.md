# Cinetag (Favorite Movies/Videos Project)

This project is a React application that allows you to list, view, and favorite videos, using the [Context API](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) for global state management. It was developed following best practices in folder structure and component organization, aiming at scalability and simple maintenance.

## üî® Project Features

- **Video Listing:** Videos are fetched from a mock API (JSON Server) and displayed on the home page.  
- **Favorite/Unfavorite:** By clicking on the ‚ÄúFavorite‚Äù icon, the selected video is added or removed from the favorites list.  
- **Video Playback (Player):** Clicking on a video redirects you to a route containing a video player.  
- **Global Favorites Management:** Implemented with the `Context API`, keeping the favorites list available throughout the app.  
- **Internal Routing:** [React Router](https://reactrouter.com) is used for navigation between pages (Home, Favorites, Player, and 404).  
- **Favorites Page:** Displays only the videos marked as favorites.  
- **Error Page (404):** Displayed when the user tries to access a non-existent route.

## üåê Deploy

To deploy this React application to a hosting service such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), you can follow these steps:

1. **Production Build**  
   Generate the optimized production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```
   A `build/` folder with all the ready-to-use static files will be created.

2. **Host the `build/` Folder**
    - Upload the `build/` folder (or point your service to it).
    - On platforms like Netlify or Vercel, simply drag the `build/` folder or configure the Git repository.
    - Done! Your application will be online.
